# Triagely

Triagely is a productivity tool that helps users manage messages and notifications from Gmail and Slack.

## Features

*   **Gmail Integration:** Connect your Gmail account to receive and manage emails within Triagely.
*   **Slack Integration:** Connect your Slack workspace to receive and manage messages within Triagely.
*   **Message Polling:** Triagely periodically checks for new messages and notifications from your connected accounts.
*   **Unified Inbox:** View all your messages and notifications in a single, streamlined interface (assumption based on typical productivity tool functionality).
*   **Authentication:** Secure user authentication using AWS Cognito.

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Web Frontend:** React (JavaScript)
*   **Mobile App:** React Native (JavaScript)
*   **Authentication:** AWS Cognito
*   **Database:** AWS DynamoDB (inferred from `poll_gmail_forever` in `backend/app/main.py` which implies storing data)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (for web frontend and mobile app)
*   Python and pip (for backend)
*   AWS account and configured AWS CLI (for Amplify and other AWS services)

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Set up your environment variables. You'll likely need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Refer to `backend/app/core/secrets.py` and the Gmail/Slack integration documentation for required variables.
5.  Run the FastAPI development server:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will typically be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Web Frontend

1.  Navigate to the `web` directory:
    ```sh
    cd web
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Set up your environment variables. You may need to create a `.env` file in the `web` directory, especially for connecting to the backend and AWS Amplify. Refer to `web/src/aws-exports.js` (which is usually auto-generated by Amplify) and how the frontend makes API calls.
4.  Start the React development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The web frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Mobile App

1.  Navigate to the `mobile` directory:
    ```sh
    cd mobile
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Ensure you have Expo CLI installed:
    ```sh
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```
4.  Set up your environment variables. Similar to the web frontend, this will likely involve configuring AWS Amplify. Refer to `mobile/src/aws-exports.js`. The `mobile/app.json` might also contain relevant configuration under an `extra` field for the API base URL.
5.  Start the Expo development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the Expo developer tools in your browser. You can then run the app on an emulator/simulator or on a physical device using the Expo Go app.
